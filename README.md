> A hands-on project demonstrating a resilient, dynamically scalable microservices architecture by orchestrating Docker containers on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster with Helm, Istio, and intelligent autoscaling.

This repository documents the journey of containerizing applications with Docker, deploying them onto a self-managed Kubernetes cluster, and managing them with production-grade tools. The goal is to simulate a real-world, scalable microservices environment that showcases practical DevOps and SRE skills for modern cloud infrastructure.

## üìå Overview

I orchestrated a resilient and dynamically scalable microservices architecture by containerizing applications with Docker and deploying them onto a self-managed Kubernetes cluster. This involved configuring sophisticated deployment strategies with Helm charts for streamlined management, implementing a service mesh using Istio for advanced traffic control and observability, and setting up intelligent autoscaling and seamless rolling updates for guaranteed high availability.

### Key Highlights:
*   **Containerization with Docker:** Applications are packaged into lightweight, portable containers.
*   **Orchestration with Kubernetes:** A self-managed Kubernetes cluster is used to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications.
*   **Streamlined Deployments with Helm:** Helm charts define, install, and upgrade the application, simplifying release management.
*   **Service Mesh with Istio:** Istio provides advanced traffic routing (canary releases), observability, and security without changing application code.
*   **Intelligent Autoscaling:** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) automatically scales pods based on CPU/memory metrics.
*   **High Availability:** Seamless rolling updates ensure zero-downtime deployments.

        end
        E[Horizontal Pod Autoscaler] -- Monitors --> C;
        E -- Monitors --> D;
    end
```*   **User Request Flow:** A user sends a request that hits the Istio Ingress Gateway.
*   **Service Mesh:** Istio routes the request to the appropriate microservice (e.g., Frontend). Services communicate with each other through the mesh.
*   **Autoscaling:** The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler monitors the CPU and memory usage of the pods and automatically scales the number of replicas up or down.
*   **Deployment:** All components are packaged and deployed as Helm charts.

## üöÄ Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
You will need the following tools installed and configured:
*   **Docker:** [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   **kubectl:** [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
*   **Helm:** [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
*   **A Kubernetes Cluster:** Such as [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/), Kind, or a cloud provider's cluster (GKE, EKS, AKS).

### 2. Set Up Your Environment
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-project>.git
    cd <your-project>
    ```
2.  **Start your local Kubernetes cluster (if using Minikube):**
    ```bash
    minikube start --driver=docker
    ```
3.  **Build and push Docker images:**
    *(For local Minikube, point your Docker daemon to the Minikube environment)*
    ```bash
    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    docker build -t frontend-app:v1 ./frontend
    docker build -t backend-app:v1 ./backend
    ```

### 3. Install Istio and Prepare the Namespace
1.  **Install Istio with the demo profile:**
    ```bash
    istioctl install --set profile=demo -y
    ```
2.  **Label the `default` namespace for automatic Istio sidecar injection:**
    ```bash
    kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
    ```

### 4. Deploy the Application with Helm
1.  **Navigate to the Helm chart directory and deploy:**
    ```bash
    helm install my-app ./helm-charts/my-app
    ```
    You can monitor the status of the deployment with `kubectl get pods,svc,deployment`.

### 5. Observe and Test
1.  **Test Autoscaling:**
    Generate load on a service to trigger the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
    ```bash
    # In one terminal, watch the HPA
    kubectl get hpa -w

    # In another terminal, run a load generator
    kubectl run -i --tty load-generator --image=busybox /bin/sh
    # Inside the pod's shell:
    # while true; do wget -q -O- http://frontend-service; done
    ```
    You will see the number of pod replicas increase to meet the demand.

2.  **Perform a Rolling Update:**
    To deploy a new version with zero downtime, update the image tag in your `values.yaml` file and run a Helm upgrade.
    ```bash
    # In helm-charts/my-app/values.yaml, change image tag to v2
    helm upgrade my-app ./helm-charts/my-app
    ```
    Monitor the rollout status:
    ```bash
    kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend-app-deployment
    ```

3.  **Implement a Canary Release:**
    Apply an Istio `VirtualService` to split traffic between two versions of your application. For example, to send 10% of traffic to `v2`:
    ```yaml
    # canary-release.yaml
    apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
    kind: VirtualService
    metadata:
      name: my-app-virtualservice
    spec:
      hosts:
        - "my-app.example.com" # Replace with your host
      http:
      - route:
        - destination:
            host: frontend-service
            subset: v1
          weight: 90
        - destination:
            host: frontend-service
            subset: v2
          weight: 10
    ```
    Apply the manifest: `kubectl apply -f canary-release.yaml`.
